# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### [Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

*In five courses, I learnt about the foundations of Deep Learning, understood how to build neural networks, and learnt how to lead successful machine learning projects. I learnt about CNNs, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. I worked on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing.*
